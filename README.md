# Event Lottery System Application

## Project Overview

The Event Lottery System is an Android application designed to offer a fair and accessible way for everyone to sign up for popular community center events. This application utilizes a lottery system to randomly select attendees from a waiting list, thus ensuring that everyone has an equal opportunity to participate.

## Features

- **Pooling System**: Enables organizers to randomly select participants from a waiting list.
- **QR Code Scanning**: Allows users to quickly access event details and join waiting lists by scanning QR codes.
- **Firebase Integration**: Uses Firebase for managing real-time data including event details and attendee lists.
- **Multi-User Roles**: Differentiates between user roles such as entrants, organizers, and administrators, providing appropriate privileges.
- **Image Upload**: Event organizers can upload and manage images related to the events.
- **Geolocation Verification** (Optional): Verifies a user's location when they attempt to join a waiting list, ensuring the authenticity of their registration.
