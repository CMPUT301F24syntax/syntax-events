Event Lottery System Application

Project Overview

The Event Lottery System is an Android mobile application designed to streamline the process of signing up for community center events that are popular and quickly filled. It aims to provide a fair and accessible way for everyone, including those with limitations such as work commitments or disabilities, to register for events without the need to constantly refresh a webpage.

Description

This application introduces a lottery-based registration system where potential attendees can join a waiting list for an event. After a specified period, the system randomly selects attendees from the list, ensuring everyone has an equal chance of participating without the pressure of immediate sign-ups.

Features

	•	Pooling System: Event organizers can draw attendees from a waiting list to fill spots.
	•	QR Code Scanning: Allows quick registration and event information retrieval through scanning QR codes.
	•	Firebase Integration: Uses Firebase to store event details, attendee lists, and manage real-time updates.
	•	Multi-User Roles: Supports different roles for entrants, organizers, and administrators, each with specific privileges.
	•	Image Upload: Enables organizers to upload event posters.
	•	Geolocation Verification (Optional): Verifies the participant’s location when joining the waiting list, ensuring local community engagement.
